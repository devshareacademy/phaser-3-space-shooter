# Phaser 3 - Space Shooter Game

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

A fun arcade space shooter built with [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)!

This is the official code repository for the [Phaser 3 Game Tutorial - Space Shooter](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmcXe0-sfoShHpVWLDW2gqsyH1UFRni_2) series available on YouTube.

## Demo

You can find a playable demo of the game on Itch.io here: [Demo](https://galemius.itch.io/phaser-3-space-shooter)

## Local Setup

This project is currently setup to require a very minimal amount of tools to run the web application. The main tools that are needed are:

- IDE (Integrated Development Environment), or any program you can use to edit code.
  - In the video tutorial series linked above, I use the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and this code base has some out of the box settings and extensions that are recommended for formatting and running the code.
- A local web server, this is needed due to browser security and how we are loading files with the Phaser 3 framework for our game.
  - You can use any local web server you are familiar with, however if you use VS Code, I recommend the following extension [LiveServer by Ritwick Dey](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Currently, the only supported way to play the game is with a Keyboard.
